                    Meeting up with Captain Donnelly and Finbarr, we’ve got a new case to handle with the same M.O., and it’s starting to look all too familiar. Let’s hope we can catch some sort of lead…

                <p class="end-p"> Hold left, sprint, and the enter vehicle button. That’s it </p>

                <p>
                    Arriving at the crime scene, skip the beginning cutscene. After the unskippable cutscene, inspect the body and her right hand specifically to investigate the ripped library card. Then make sure you skip the cutscene after you put it back.
                </p>

                <img src="resources/img/Homicide/any%25/silk-stocking-murder/library-card-right.jpg" alt="Strangely, we're only getting one half of the library card">

                <p>
                    Turn around to go back up the alleyway, and you’re now going to follow a trail of “blood” that will lead us to our next clue.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Follow the path behind you, going towards the big police squad car peeking out from the corner. Turn left around it, and head up the fire escape ahead.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once you’re on the roof, hang a right in front of the pigeon coop, go over the ledge and jog towards the climbable pole atthe other corner of the roof and scale it. Climb up and over the final bloody ledge to finally inspect the victim’s purse across the way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the purse, investigate further to find the other half of the library card. Start putting it away and as you do, marker over to the <a href="any%25-silk-stocking-murder.html#antonia">Antonia Residence</a> with the map. The game will teleport you to the car, and have Galloway drive you there.

                    Skip the arrival cutscene, knock on the door, skip the next cutscene. Go down the hall and head up the stairs on the left, and the entrance to her apartment is on your immediate left.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Immediately head in and inspect the letter in the suitcase. Inspect it further to open it up and scroll down on the letter.

                <p class="end-p">
                    Once you get the objective to investigate Maldonaldo residence, go back the way you came and the car is on the left out of the main entrance. Have Galloway take you to the <a href="any%25-silk-stocking-murder.html#maldonaldo">Maldonado Residence</a>.
                </p>



                <h3 id="maldonado">Maldonado Residence</h3>

                <p>
                    Skip the arrival cutscene. Walk through the double doors and go up the flight of stairs on the right. At the top of the stairs, a cutscene will play and you will be put into a fist fight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Skip the cutscene, and immediately hold down the aim and only dodge and counter throughout the whole fight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once you’ve successfully beat them up, go forward and keep turning right to get to the kitchen. Inspect the bloody shirt hanging on the wall, left of the fridge, and specifically the bloodstain near the collar.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then go out the nearby door on the left, head down the whole set of stairs and hang a left to get back to your car. Hold down the enter vehicle button, and marker with the notebook to the crime scene, however you don’t actually want to go back to the crime scene. You want to actually have the radio call fully come in before you press the skip button, and the radio call only triggers once Galloway starts driving the vehicle.
                </p>

                <p class="end-p">
                    Wait for Galloway to drive a little, and then press the skip button. You’ll know if you did it right when you see on the left side of the screen, that your new objective is to go back to <a href="any%25-silk-stocking-murder.html#central">Central Station</a>.
                </p>



                <h3 id="central">Central Station</h3>

                <p>
                    Back at Central Station, skip the cutscene, head down the hallway on the right, take the stairs down to the basement and turn left to go into the technical services room. From now on, I’ll just say, “Head down to the technical services room,” as this will happen another time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Skip the cutscene going in and inspect the message and the poem.

                    Skip the cutscene after inspection, head back up the stairs and go into the interrogation room on the left  after the double doors to interview Angel Maldonado.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While interviewing Angel, marker over to your next location, which is underneath the interrogation graphic.

                <p class="end-p">
                    After the interrogation, go back to the car and have galloway drive you to the <a href="any%25-silk-stocking-murder.html#just-picked">Just Picked Fruit Market</a>

                <p>
                    The spawn can be fickle, so make sure you do run into the parking lot of the market to trigger the cutscene.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Skip the cutscene and go to the back of the market to talk and question the cashier.

                    Head over to the green double doors to reveal a secret stash of booze. Skip the cutscene and walk behind and to the left to pick up the scalpel on the corner of the desk behind you.

                <img src="resources/img/Homicide/any%25/silk-stocking-murder/scalpel.jpg" alt="The bloody scalpel on the desk">

                <p>
                    Putting down the scalpel and skipping the cutscene will trigger a car chase with Clem. To fail it quickly, turn left on the road and take the first left. Do that three times and skip the whole chase.
                </p>

                <p class="end-p">
                    Skip the finishing cutscenes to end the case.
