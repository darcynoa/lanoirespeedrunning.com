<h2> What is the main purpose of this website? </h2>

<p>
    This website serves as a guide to those that want to get into speedrunning the game L.A. Noire. It includes all the categories such as Any%, 100%, 5 Star%, and many of the other ones so you will never run out of options. It also will contain blog posts that can be used as devlogs, to announce a new section or updated section of the website, or to give the latest news in L.A. Noire Speedrunning. 
</p>
<p>
    However, because of how much content there is, it will truly be a never ending project that will constantly be updated. So come along this ride with me!
