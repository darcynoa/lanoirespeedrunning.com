                Skipping the cutscene will put you in the car automatically . Turn on the siren and chase after her to fail the tailing. Repeat two more times until you are able to skip the action.

            <p>
                After skipping, the game wants you to hide in the restaurant to listen in on Ballard’s phone call. Immediately turn on the siren, and it will immediately fail. Doing so two more times will allow you to skip the stealth mission.

            <p>
                Skip the cutscene going into the apartment. Head through the hallway and go around the left corner, there will be a photograph on the cabinet to inspect as shown.

            <p>
                Go right and inspect the gleaming mirror on the far back wall. After Bekowsky says “Humor him,” there’s a point where you can skip by backing out of the clue early, but it’s a very hard skip to consistently pull off.

                For this next part, you will try to shoot Mark Bishop to skip the shootout with McAfee’s goons. The concept is to aim next to him, then as you shoot you put the cursor over him to intentionally shoot him, as the game won't just allow you to shoot him intuitively.
            </p>

            <p>
                For this first one, if you can't shoot him as he is about to climb the ladder, you can shoot him through the wooden scaffolding as shown here.
