                    I thought with this opening blog post, I would be able to introduce myself and what I plan to do with this website formally, rather than cram it into the about page in the home page.

                    First and foremost, I am known as Hydrox48 and I have done L.A. Noire speedrunning for little over six months now (at the time at which I am typing this up).

                    My streams are awful in video quality, but I try to make up for it by only running full runs and not trying to entertain practice runs which I would do offline.  Because I don’t have the greatest setup for streaming, I don’t do much streaming and have been thinking about just recording my runs and uploading them to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/hydrox48">Twitch</a> but that’s a different blog post to ramble on about.

                    I started learning web development over the summer of 2019, and really found it fun once I learned the basics.  Now that I have this skill, how could I apply it into web development and what would I create from it? I decided that my first website project would be dedicated to speedrunning in L.A. Noire.

                    From just my experience, all the guides are just google docs of different people’s notes on how they run the game for that category.  I could record video guides - which are available for L.A. Noire Normal Any% - I’m not too much of a fan of video guides for speedruns as strategies and routes can change over time. With a website, I can write the guide and update it when a new strategy is found.

                <p class="end-p">
                    I believe this website will be a never-ending project, not only for it's seemingly bottomless amount of categories, but because strategies will change over time.  However, even if all the categories have been filled up, there will be blog posts like this that will keep the website fresh and new. Of course life hits everyone, so this won’t be something I will actively try to update, but this is just a fun side project that I hope anyone can go on and if they wish, they can learn how to run this awesome game.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Blog posts like this will be my main avenue of communication on when an update will come out so stick around for that.
