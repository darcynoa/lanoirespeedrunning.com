                Another homicide has been called in, and another naked woman lying dead in a park. Phelps wants to believe that it's too familiar for it to be just another murder, but Galloway has seen it all and assumes it's just another domestic case. Sounds right to me, arrest the husband!
            </p>

            <p>
                Same route out of the building, same camera trick, only this time walk towards Cole's right to get to Galloway’s vehicle rather than the standard patrol car parked in the usual spot.
            </p>

            <h3 id="crime-scene">Crime Scene</h3>

            <p>
                Skip the initial cutscene and head around the left of the crowd and through the bushes and over the wire barrier.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first thing you’ll encounter is a purse with the victim’s nameplate tucked in. When you’re putting it away, you’ll notice that Phelps will have Patrolman Gonzalez run R&I on her name.
            </p>

                Next, we must inspect the body. The head, and both hands will be inspected by holding left, and her chest will be automatically inspected.

            <p>
                After inspecting all the clues, go around the opposite side of where you came from to see Patrolman Gonzalez hanging up the phone on the callbox.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stand to the right of the log thingy and wait for Gonzalez to say “detectives.” Open up your notebook, go to locations, and marker to Moller Residence when it’s available. Then have Galloway drive you there in that patrol car right next to the callbox.
            </p>

            <p>
                You may have to play around with the timing of when you want to hold the enter/exit vehicle button. For me, once I have placed the marker, I found it's best to just walk towards the car, then hold F after Galloway says, "Wrapped up." I will make a note myself to see what is consistent.
            </p>

            <h3 id="moller-residence">Moller Residence</h3>

            <p>
                Arriving at the Moller Residence, you’re going to walk up to the door, skip the two cutscenes, hit the talk button, then skip another cutscene, to then be able to question Michelle Moller
            </p>

            <ul class="interrogation michelle end-p">
                <li>Last contact with victim: Doubt</li>
                <li>Jewelry removed from body: Lie</li>
                <li>State of parents' marriage: Lie</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="end-p">
                Skip the following cutscene to then interrogate Hugo Moller, who is now a suspect.
            </p>

            <ul class="interrogation hugo">
                <li>Footprints at crime scene: Truth</li>
                <li>Alibi for Hugo Moller: Truth</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Once the interrogation is done, skip the part of the cutscene where the pair of detectives are starting to leave. Then run across the street to find out what the neighbor wants with you.
            </p>

            <img src="resources/img/Homicide/any%25/the-golden-butterfly/neighbor.jpg">

            <p>
                She’ll point that she sees Hugo going over to the incinerator, run over to Hugo along the side of his house, then chase after him in the alleyway. Pretty self explanatory, tackle him down with the associated button (LMB, <span style="color:#3cdb4e;">A</span> or <span style="color:#5598ba;">X</span>).
            </p>

            <p>
                Skip the cutscene, and walk over to the incinerator to inspect right on the bloody size 8 shoe.
            </p>

            <img src="resources/img/Homicide/any%25/the-golden-butterfly/bloody-shoe.jpg">

            <p class="end-p">
                Put the shoe down immediately to skip the partial dialogue. A cutscene plays out the rest of the interactions with what is left of the Moller family.
            </p>

            <h3 id="route-to-belmont-high">Route to Belmont High</h3>

            <p>
                This will be one of the only times where driving to a location is faster than having your partner drive. Go into Galloway’s car, turn around and follow the route.
            </p>

            <p>

                Skipping the cutscene, you will be put into a foot chase. Instead of going straight, turn around and get into the second closest car, which should be parked in front of the gap in the hedges.
            </p>
            <p>
                Drive through that hedge gap, start driving and turning left, and aim to drive in front of the truck parked near the field goal post. The ultimate goal is to go in front of the suspect to end the chase immediately.

                Once in front of him, he will stop and put his hands up. Arrest him to go into a cutscene.

Skip the cutscene of him getting arrested, and you’ll now be speaking with the janitor.

            <p>
